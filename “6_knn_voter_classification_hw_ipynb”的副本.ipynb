        "When a voter is approached, they are asked if they are willing to fill out a questionnaire. Typically about 40-50% agree. (For those that decline, the interviewer visually estimates their age, race, and gender, and notes this information, so that the response rate by demographic is known and responses can be weighted accordingly in order to be more representative of the population.)\n",

        "Voters that agree to participate are then given an form with 15-20 questions. They fill in the form (anonymously), fold it, and put it in a small ballot box.\n",

In general, when there are no missing values, for a pair of samples each feature is either *similar* or *different*. Thus a metric like L1 distance, which explicitly measures the extent to which features are *different*, also implicitly captures the extent to which features are *similar*. When samples can have missing values, though, for a pair of samples each feature is either *similar*, *different*, or *unknown* (one or both samples is missing that value). In this case, a distance metric that only measures the extent of *difference* (like L1 or L2 distance) does not capture whether the features that are not different are *similar* or *unknown*. (Our custom distance metric, which is an L1 distance, treats values that are *unknown* as if they are *similar* - neither one increases the distance.)
